# ansible-role-docker-prep

Prep a RH7 Server for Docker

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      become: yes
      become_user: root
      roles:
        - role: staylorx.docker-prep
